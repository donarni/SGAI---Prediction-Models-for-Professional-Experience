# SGAI - Prediction Models for Professional Experience

Salary prediction holds significant importance for both employers and employees. While prediction models can be trained using salary datasets, they typically lack information regarding a crucial factor for the salary: professional experience.

To improve salary predictions, Jannik Kiesel estimated the professional experience using regression models trained on the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) dataset. The regression models represent the culmination of his Bachelor's thesis and are now available for download in .txt and .ppml format, which seamlessly integrates with regression models accessible via https://scikit-learn.org/.

Please refer to the cited publication for more details on the estimation of professional experience.
